# LangGraph Agent for Competitive Coding
Implementation of a LangGraph agent powered by a fine-tuned LLM to solve competitive coding problems

## Highlights
- Fine-tuned a Llama 3.1 model using [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai/) to solve competitive coding problems in C++
- Implemented a LangGraph agent powered by the fine-tuned LLM to solve the coding problem, also incorporating **human-in-the-loop feedback**
- Incorporated code evaluation and execution in a sandboxed environment using [Judge0](https://judge0.com/)
