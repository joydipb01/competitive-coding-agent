You will be given a competitive programming problem. Please reason step by step about the solution, then write detailed pseudocode to uncover any potential logical errors or omissions, and finally provide a complete implementation in C++14.

Your solution must read input from standard input (cin), write output to standard output (cout).
Do not include any debug prints or additional output.

Put your final solution within a single code block:
```cpp
<your code here>
```
